The comapny name is "Mount Cars," based on locations given: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Mount+Cars+Ltd/@51.6329766,0.0069819,17z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x47d8a085067f6a13:0x29633b5eaac31d84!2sMount+Cars+Ltd!8m2!3d51.6329766!4d0.0095568!16s%2Fg%2F11crzxcrcb!3m5!1s0x47d8a085067f6a13:0x29633b5eaac31d84!8m2!3d51.6329766!4d0.0095568!16s%2Fg%2F11crzxcrcb?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMzMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D

I know she can't be saying "at the defense," but I don't know what else she could be saying there.

Airbus Cars?

It's also hella not clear what Speaker 1 says in either of these lines (pretty sure he's smashed):

```json
{
    "timestamp": "00:00:22",
    "role": "Speaker 1",
    "content": "27 Rose Tree Avenue."
},
{
    "timestamp": "00:00:25",
    "role": "Speaker 0",
    "content": "Where is it gonna go?"
},
{
    "timestamp": "00:00:26",
    "role": "Speaker 1",
    "content": "Local, Kirkwalk."
},
```

Not sure about "Rose Tree Ave," and "Kirkwalk" isn't a place anywhere except Australia (and it's a hike or walk). He's definitely saying something that ends with a K though (so not Kirkwall). Curwalk? Cairnwalk? Kernwulk. IDK.

Fairly sure this is the business, though:

As best I can tell, "Orwellard" is not a word, nor is it something that sounds like anything around Central Stokes (Stoke-on-Trent). Additionally, the addresses "17 Oakwell Place" and "22 Corby Park Close" are also nonexistent.

I know he can't be saying "The King Trip"...

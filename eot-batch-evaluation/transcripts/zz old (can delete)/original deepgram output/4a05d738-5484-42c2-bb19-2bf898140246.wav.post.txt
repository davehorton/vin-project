00:00:10 Speaker 0: Hello. Go Green. Hi. Good morning. I am just calling as I've booted taxi on the app, but I see that it still says allocating driver.

00:00:19 Speaker 0: I'm just wanting to check if everything was alright. Let me just have a look. I can see a driver has received it. Sorry. Our system takes a little bit of time just to upgrade.

00:00:35 Speaker 0: Problem. Ah, okay. Let's just have a look. Unfortunately, it looks like that driver didn't take it. So let's go and see what's happening.

00:00:52 Speaker 0: Sorry. The system's now reallocating somebody. Alright. Can I give you a callback in just one second just to let the system sort itself out? Yeah.

00:01:07 Speaker 0: Of course. Thank you. And then I can give you a proper ETA. That would be perfect. Thank you so much.

00:01:13 Speaker 0: Alright. Thank you. Bye now. Bye.

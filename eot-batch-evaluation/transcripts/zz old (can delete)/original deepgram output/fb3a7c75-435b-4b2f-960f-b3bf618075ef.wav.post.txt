00:00:12 Speaker 1: Hi, Adrian. It's Dan, Ream Interiors in Gillingham. I was just calling really just to see how you got on with the most recent revised quotation I've done for you. If you give us a callback in the showroom, failing that, I'll give you a call a little bit later. I'm gonna drop you an email as well, and, hopefully, I will speak to you soon.

00:00:30 Speaker 1: Cheers. Bye.
